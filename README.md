# Intro
Python Code based on the Sensibo Python SDK and Pull Requests Authors

Client script is a basic script to interogate the Sensibo API

Daemon script is a python daemon script which can download all the data exposed by the API and store it in a local database. sensibo.conf can be copied to /etc and chmod 600 to protect the apikey and database password.

The PHP scripts are used to display the data as a line graphs and can turn your AC on and off.
