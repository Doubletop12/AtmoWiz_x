Sensibo Python SDK

Client script is a basic script to interogate the Sensibo API

Daemon script is a python daemon script which can download all the data exposed by the API and store it in a local database. sensibo.conf can be copied to /etc and chmod 600 to protect the apikey and database password.

index.php and mariadb.php are used to display the data as a line graphs.
